# MERN Boilerplate

## Introduction

This is a full-stack boilerplate using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

The `main` branch contains the starter code for a basic React project (initialized with `create-react-app`) using [MUI](https://mui.com) and an Express server connected to MongoDB.

The `completed` branch contains the code to a fully-functioning, dockerized, web app with user authentication.
